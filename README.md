1. Mr. Bournville loves programming and he likes to face new programming challenges. After completing many challenges he has now given you one challenge which is one of his favourites. He has given you a list of N random integers and he wants you to find the integer which has the maximum frequency in the given list.
Being a programmer himself, he had made this task a challenge for you and he will calculate your score for this task using a formula.
Formula for calculating the score : (max_score) - (number of characters in your code/15.0)
Mr. Bournville already has a solution for this but he is not satisfied with his solution. He wants you to write a shortest possible code for this task. In case Frequency of two numbers is same print the smaller one

2. You are required to enter a word that consists of  and  that denote the number of Zs and Os respectively. The input word is considered similar to word zoo if .
Determine if the entered word is similar to word zoo.
For example, words such as zzoooo and zzzoooooo are similar to word zoo but not the words such as zzooo and zzzooooo.

3. You have been given 3 integers - l, r and k. Find how many numbers between l and r (both inclusive) are divisible by k. You do not need to print these numbers, you just have to find their count.
Input Format
The first and only line of input contains 3 space separated integers l, r and k.
Output Format
Print the required answer on a single line.

4. Rahul is a very busy persion he dont wan't to waste his time . He keeps account of duration of each and every work. Now he don't even get time to calculate duration of works, So your job is to count the durations for each work and give it to rahul.

5. The program is to use the brute-force approach in order to find the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. More precisely... rewrite small numbers from input to output. Stop processing input after reading in the number 42. All numbers at input are integers of one or two digits.

6. An elephant decided to visit his friend. It turned out that the elephant's house is located at point 0 and his friend's house is located at point  of the coordinate line. In one step the elephant can move 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 positions forward.
Determine, what is the minimum number of steps he need to make in order to get to his friend's house.

7. Indian army is going to do a surprise attack on one of its enemies country. The President of India, the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army will be sending an alert message to all its commanding centers. As enemy would be monitoring the message, Indian army is going to encrypt(cipher) the message using basic encryption technique. A decoding key 'K' (number) would be sent secretly.
You are assigned to develop a cipher program to encrypt the message. Your cipher must rotate every character in the message by a fixed number making it unreadable by enemies.
Given a single line of string 'S' containing alpha, numeric and symbols, followed by a number '0<=N<=1000'. Encrypt and print the resulting string.
Note: The cipher only encrypts Alpha and Numeric. (A-Z, a-z, and 0-9) . All Symbols, such as - , ; %, remain unencrypted.
